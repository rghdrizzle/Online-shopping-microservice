**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of an 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.
This application is developed by Google and I simply tend to use this microservice application to showcase and practice my skills on the devops workflow and tools. Documentation will be updated soon along with other configuration files
